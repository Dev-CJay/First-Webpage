    <h1>THE STORY OF EMMANUEL</h1>
    <h2>The Gentle Man Buglar</h2>

    <p>So Emmanuel carefully read the story of Asin Lupin, and thought as much that he could be like him (In his wildest dreams)
    </p>
    <p>After spending close to 25 years studying and learning how Asin Lupin worked and crafted out his moves, he decides to take his first challange. </p><p>
    </p>
    <p>He first challange was an attempt on the Central Bank of Nigeria. Impossible or not, he gave it a shot. He made a successful entery into the bank, got past all securities
        and secutity cameras. He eventually gat to the vault, gained access, came out with a handful of cash, got out through the exit he created sometimes back only 
    to meet a lot of securities and got apprehended.  </p>
    <p>To cut the long story short, his mission wasn't a success and a total waste of time. for this reason, many people reffered to him as the foolish Buglar</p>
    <p>He has been behind bars for over 25 years and he is still awaiting trials.</p>
